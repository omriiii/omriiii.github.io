online portfolio

*master-branch* - Distribution code

### TO DO
* modularize projects page with nunjucks

* on desktop have the homepage use `container-fluid` whereas on mobile we just use `container`
* reshoot a video for tmf since it's a pixely gif mess rn
* add online portfolio as a project
* add desc to each thumb
